# Exercises for Network  layer: Forwarding and IP

## Exercises from Chapter 3 of Kurose and Ross on "Transport Layer"

* P40
* P51 (P53 in 8.ed)

## Exercises from Chapter 4 of Kurose and Ross on "Network Layer: Data Plane"

* P5 (P8 in 8.ed)
* P8 (P11 in 8.ed)
* P15 (P17 in 8.ed)

## Exercises from Chapter 5 of Kurose and Ross on "Network Layer: Control Plane"

* We will be looking at routing algorithms in Wednesday's lecture. The link state routing algorithm uses Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm that you have studied previously in your algorithms course. The following exercises allow you to recap the algorithm.
  * P3
  * P4 (Optional)
