# Tools

Throughout the course we will use C as programming language, so it is important that you have access to a compiler on your machine. For this we recommend GCC (https://gcc.gnu.org/), which is also the compiler we will use check correctness of your implementations. For what we are to use, there should be no difference between the later versions, so need not to install the latest GCC that is larger than version 8.2. We will also from second week introduce GDB, so you can just as well also install this.

We will also later during the course use a simulation tool that might (or might not) cause problems on non-Linux machines. We will at this time release a VM image that you can use in case of problems. See more about running the image further below.

## Roll Your Own Toolchain
Most of you should not have a problem with running needed software on your local machine, so see OS specific pages for rolling out your toolchain.

  * [Linux tools](linux.md)
  * [maxOS tools](macos.md)
  * [Windows tools](windows.md)

## RARS
You will need to code som RISC-V assembler. Before going to the RARS tool page, read above Toolchain page for your OS.

[Details for RARS tool](rars.md).

<!-- ## Virtualbox
However, there might can be problems on the specific systems, in which case we will generally point you to a virtual machine. 

  * This will be posted later..

## Script alternatives
For some purposes we have also designed some specific scripts you can run from your terminal. These require internet access, but can be an easy alternative in some specific situations

  * To be posted later...

## Editor vs. IDE
We do not ask you to use any specific editor or IDE for the course. I can say that different teachers usage range from VIM over Emacs to Sublime Text. Most important is that you have easy access from your editor to a terminal where you can run the Make build tool and scripts for testing. See the [Preparation](../preparations/README.md) for further details.
